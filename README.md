BasicSitecoreTesting
====================

A basic project to play around with testing sitecore solutions. This solution was a demo i put together for a Sitecore Technical User Group presentation I did a little while ago. For more information have a look at the [blog post](http://navmarwaha.com/2014/11/03/tdd-unit-testing-and-microsoft-fakes-with-sitecore-solutions/).

## Setup
To use this you must have a local Sitecore dlls and Visual Studio Premium.

Assuming you have the correct version of Visual Studio, you'll need to create fake versions of the Sitecore dlls, to do this simply reference the applicable Sitecore dlls into the Unit test project, right click on them then click 'Add Fakes Assembly".
